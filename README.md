# SonicPi: MIDI live-jamming (Boilerplate) v1.0
This is a boilerplate for my MIDI driven workflow with SonicPi. I use an AKAI MIDIMIX, but you can use it with whatever MIDI controller you have.

### Features 
- Metronome -> stay always in sync (also on sleep changes)
- Pattern-Function -> define patterns for your drums
- ScaleMidi-Function -> Define a specific range your MIDI changes apply to

### Infos
You can ser your own MIDI device. 
Within the switch case you just check for the respective keys and define the desired range.
